ABCWD Shiny Dashboard: Source Code
==================================

This repo holds the source code for a shiny dashboard originally built for managers at AB ESRD to make it easier to update and fit risk models for CWD in the province. It allows users to upload cleaned surveillance data, extract relevant environmental predictors, fit models of CWD risk, and map the results.

This repository holds all source code for the shiny app deployed [here](https://fw-habitat-aep.shinyapps.io/ABCWD_Shiny/). The rasters and data necessary to run this shiny app are not loaded in this repository for security and file size reasons.

Users who have found this repository may find useful tips and answers to common questions [here](https://www.github.com/dpseidel/ABCWD_Shiny/blob/master/Tips_4_Users.md).
